## Abstract {-}

Fishery-independent surveys provide valuable information about trends in population abundance for management of commercially important fish stocks. A critical component of the relationship of the catches of the survey to the size of a fish stock is the catch efficiency of the survey gear. Using a general hierarchical model we estimated relative efficiency of chain sweep to the rockhopper sweep used by the Northeast Fisheries Science Center bottom trawl survey from paired-gear experimental tows carried out between 2015 and 2017 using a twin-trawl vessel. For 10 commercially important species, we fitted and compared a set of models with alternative assumptions about variation of relative efficiency between paired gear tows, size and diel effects on the relative efficiency, and extra-binomial variation of observations within paired gear tows. These analyses provided evidence of changes in relative efficiency with size for all species and diel effects were important for all but one species. We then used the bottom trawl survey data from surveys between 2009 and 2019 with the relative catch efficiency estimates from the best performing models to estimate annual and seasonal chain sweep-based swept area biomass for 17 managed stocks. We estimated uncertainty in all results using bootstrap procedures for each data component. We also assessed the effect of calibration on uncertainty of the biomass estimates and the degree of correlation of the annual biomass estimates.

# Introduction  

Ecosystem monitoring surveys such as fisheries-independent trawl surveys are used to obtain information on a range of species and are therefore not optimized with respect to sampling design or gear for any one species \citep{bijleveldetal12, wangetal18}.  Gear and sampling protocols are designed to provide consistent and representative samples that allow indices of abundance at size and age to be developed for a suite of species \citep{azarovitz81, thiessetal18}.  To provide indices of population abundance with minimal potential sources of bias, survey bottom trawl gear must be configured to be towed across as wide a variety of habitats as possible, including seafloor habitats with complex physical structures.  

Indices of abundance at age and size derived from fisheries independent bottom trawl surveys are scaled to population size by the survey catchability ($q$) parameter \citep{arreguinsanchez96}.  Catchability is typically estimated internally within stock assessment models that incorporate fisheries landings, indices of abundance, and life history parameters. However, the amount or quality of data and degree of contrast in the time series is often such that this parameter is difficult to estimate \citep{maunderpiner15}. In such cases, estimates of survey catchability from auxiliary data can inform the stock assessment.  These external estimates can be used as a direct input into the assessment model \citep{somertonetal99}, can serve as a diagnostic measure of model accuracy \citep{milleretal19}, or contribute to an alternate means of providing catch advice when an assessment model is not considered acceptable \citep{legaultmccurdy17}.  

Catchability can be decomposed into two components, the proportion of the population available to the survey sampling frame and the efficiency of the survey gear given an individual is available to the gear \citep{paloheimodickie64}. Here efficiency is the fraction of available fish retained by the gear, equivalent to availability-selection in \citet{millarfryer99}. Estimates of these components allow relative abundance indices to be converted into absolute abundance indices without a population model. As such, investigations of gear mensuration \citep{kotwickietal11}, species-specific gear efficiency \citep{thygesenetal19,jonesetal21}, and availability of the stock to the survey design frame  \citep{nicholetal19} improve our understanding of catchability and therefore abundance of fish stocks. 

Paired-gear studies where two gear are fished either concurrently or close together temporally and spatially have long been used to estimate the efficiency of one fishing gear relative to another \citep[e.g.,][]{gulland64,bourne65}.  Of the two gears, one is often a reference gear that may be a gear currently used for annual surveys \citep[e.g.,][]{munrosomerton01}. Typically neither of the gears is fully efficient and therefore the relative efficiency of gears is estimated \citep[e.g.,][]{miller13,kotwickietal17}, but there are cases where one of the gears is assumed to be at least very nearly fully efficient \citep[e.g.,][]{somertonetal13, milleretal19}.

Whether or not full efficiency of one of the gears is assumed, paired-gear studies are essential for generating abundance time series from fishery independent surveys when there are changes in the vessel and(or) gears over time due to gear failures or improved technology \citep{pelletier98}. These studies are also helpful for combining surveys conducted close together in space or time using alternative gears \citep{kotwickietal13}.

Within the northeast US there has been a heightened focus on bottom trawl survey operations and gear efficiency. This focus has in part resulted from low quotas for several groundfish stocks limiting fishing opportunities. To help provide clarity on the trawl operations and build trust in survey indices the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fisheries Management Councils developed a Northeast Trawl Advisory Panel. This panel is composed of members from industry, regional academics, as well as state and federal scientists. Together the group designed a set of experiments to better understand the efficiency of the bottom trawl survey gear for northeast US groundfish stocks.

In conducting paired-gear studies it is ideal to have the two gears deployed as close together spatially and temporally as possible to reduce variation between the gears in densities of the species being captured. The twin-trawl rigging \citep{kragetal15} where two trawls can be fished simultaneously approaches this ideal \citep{ices96}, and is the data-collection platform chosen by the Trawl Advisory Panel. The Panel decided to rig one of the twin trawls as the the gear used by the bottom trawl survey which uses a rockhopper sweep. The other trawl was rigged similarly except with a chain sweep in an attempt to eliminate any escapement of fish under the gear. Assuming the chain sweep-based gear is fully efficient allows the efficiency of the rockhopper sweep-based gear used by the bottom trawl survey to be estimated from these experiments.

The analytical methods to estimate the efficiency of the bottom trawl gear are based on those used by \citet{miller13} to estimate size effects on relative catch efficiency of the NOAA Ship *Henry B. Bigelow* (*Bigelow*) to the NOAA Ship *Albatross IV* for a variety of commercially important species, but we extend the model to consider different size effects for tows conducted during the day or night since both the spring and fall bottom trawl surveys conducted in the Northeast US are 24-hour operations. We apply these methods to paired gear observations and estimate relative efficiency of the chain sweep and rockhopper sweep gears.  We apply the estimated efficiency of the rockhopper gear to survey data to estimate spring and fall abundance indices from 2009-2019 for 17 commercially important fish stocks in the Northeast US (Table \ref{stock_definition_table}).

Often overlooked aspects of the application of relative catch efficiency estimates is the impact on the precision of abundance indices and the correlation among annual indices that the application induces. These indices are typically used as measures of relative abundance in stock assessment with the precision of the indices used to weight the observations within the assessment model. Furthermore, the sampling variability of the annual indices is typically assumed to be independent. Here we compare the precision of the calibrated and uncalibrated indices and measure the correlation of calibrated indices for each stock.

# Methods

## Data collection

Data were collected during three field experiments carried out in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, aboard the *F/V Karen Elizabeth*, a 23.8m (78ft) stern trawler capable of towing two trawls simultaneously side by side. However, red hake were only observed during the 2017 field experiments. One side of the twin-trawl rig towed a NEFSC standard 400 x 12 cm survey bottom trawl rigged with the NEFSC standard rockhopper sweep \citep{politisetal14} (Figure \ref{rockhopper_schematic}). The other side of the twin-trawl rig towed a version of the NEFSC 400 x 12cm survey bottom trawl modified to maximize the capture of flatfish. The trawl was modified by reducing the headline flotation from 66 to 32, 20cm, spherical floats, reducing the port and starboard top wing-end extensions by 50cm each and utilizing a chain sweep. The chain sweep was constructed of 1.6cm ($\frac{5}{8}$in) trawl chain covered by 12.7cm diameter x 1cm thick rubber discs on every other chain link (Figure \ref{chainsweep_schematic}). Two rows of 1.3cm ($\frac{1}{2}$in) tickler chains were attached to the 1.6cm trawl chain by 1.3cm shackles. To ensure equivalent net geometry of each gear, 32m restrictor ropes, made of 1.4cm ($\frac{9}{16}$in) buoyant, Polytron rope, were attached between each of the trawl doors and the center clump. 3.4m$^2$ Thyboron Type 4 trawl doors were used to provide enough spreading force to ensure the restrictor ropes remained taut throughout each tow. Each trawl used the NEFSC standard 36.6m bridles. All tows followed the NEFSC standard survey towing protocols of 20 minutes at 3.0 knots. In 2015, 108 (45 day, 63 night) paired tows were conducted in eastern Georges Bank and off of southern New England (Figure \ref{tow_locations}). In 2016, 117 (74 day, 43 night) paired tows were conducted in western Gulf of Maine and the northern edge of Georges Bank.  In 2017, 103 (61 day, 42 night) paired tows were conducted in the western Gulf of Maine and off of southern New England. Paired tows were denoted as "day" and "night"  by whether the sun was above or below the horizon at the time of the tow. 


## Paired-tow analysis

We employed the hierarchical modeling approach from \citet{miller13} to estimate the efficiency ($\rho$) of the rockhopper sweep used by the NEFSC bottom trawl survey relative to the chain sweep-based gear for ten species (Summer flounder, *Paralichthys dentatus*; American plaice, *Hippoglossoides platessoides*; windowpane flounder, *Scophthalmus aquosus*; winter flounder, *Pseudopleuronectes americanus*; yellowtail flounder, *Limanda ferruginea*; witch flounder, *Glyptocephalus cynoglossus*; red hake, *Urophycis chuss*; goosefish, *Lophius americanus*; barndoor skate, *Dipturus laevis*; thorny skate, *Amblyraja radiata*) from three separate research trips carried out aboard a twin trawl vessel. We first fit and compared the same set of 13 models as  \citet{miller13} with different assumptions about variation of relative efficiency between paired gear tows, size effects on the relative efficiency, and extra-binomial variation of observations within paired gear tows. The binomial (BI$_0$ to BI$_4$) and beta-binomial (BB$_0$ to BB$_7$) models that were fitted for all species are described in Table \ref{base_model_description} including pseudo-formulas analogous to those used to specify and fit mixed or generalized additive models in R \citep{R19,wood06}. We then also included diel effects on relative catch efficiency and interactions with size effects with the best performing model of the original 13 models for each species. To fit these diel effects, we generalized the modeling framework somewhat in that we allow multiple (cubic regression spline) smooth effects, differing by day and night, on relative catch efficiency. We implemented the models using the Template Model Builder package \citep{kristensenetal16} in R and we used the "nlminb" optimizer to fit the models by maximizing the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood \citep{R19}. 

If the best model included smooth length effects and the estimated smoothing parameter implied a linear functions of length (on the transformed mean), then simple linear functions (i.e., completely smooth) were assumed for further models that included diel effects on relative efficiency. As such, there was one less (smoothing) parameter estimated for these models.

We compared two alternative ways of estimating uncertainty in relative catch efficiency. The first estimation approach uses the inverted hessian of the marginal log-likelihood and the delta-method to estimate uncertainty in the predicted relative catch efficiency at size. The second method, is a bootstrap method where we refit models to bootstrap resamples of the paired station data. Specifically, we resampled the paired tows with replacement so that the total number of paired tows was the same for a given species, but the total number of length measurements varied depending on which of the paired tows entered the sample for a particular bootstrap. We made 1000 bootstrap samples and estimated relative catch efficiency at size from each bootstrap data set if the fitted model converged and the hessian at the maximized log-likelihood was invertible.

For models BI$_4$, BB$_6$, and BB$_7$, there are two fixed effects parameters associated with the spline coefficients that are treated as random effects for station-specific smoothers and the correlation of these pairs of random effects is estimated. However, this parameter was not estimable for red hake for BB$_6$ and assumed equal to zero.

## Length-weight analysis

We fit length-weight relationships to the length and weight observations for each survey each year. We assumed weight observation $j$ from survey $i$, was log-normal distributed,
\begin{equation}\label{wal}
 \log W_{ij} \sim \text{N}\left(\log \alpha_i + \beta_i \log L_{ij} - \frac{\sigma_i^2}{2}, \sigma_i^2\right)
\end{equation}
We used a bias correction to ensure the expected weight $E(W_{ij})= \alpha_i L_{ij}^{\beta_i}$. We estimated parameters by maximizing the model likelihood programmed with the Template Model Builder package [@kristensenetal16] and R [@R19] and generated predictions of weight at length 
\begin{equation}\label{predwal}
\widehat W(L) = \widehat \alpha L^{\widehat \beta}.
\end{equation}
Like the relative catch efficiency, we made bootstrap predictions of weight at length by sampling with replacement the length-weight observations within each annual survey and refitting the length-weight relationship to each of the bootstrap data sets.

## Biomass estimation

For the 17 managed stocks that are populations of the species in the Northeast US where we have estimated relative efficiency, we estimated stock biomass for each spring and fall annual survey assuming 100\% efficiency of the chain sweep gear by scaling the survey tow observations by the relative efficiency of the chain sweep and rockhopper sweep gears. Summer and witch flounders, American plaice, and barndoor and thorny skates are managed as single unit stocks, but there are three stocks of winter and yellowtail flounders, and two stocks of windowpane, red hake, and goosefish (Table \ref{stock_definition_table}). First, the tow-specific catches at length are rescaled,
\begin{equation}\label{nal}
\widetilde N_{hi}\left(L\right) = N_{hi}\left(L\right)\widehat \rho_i\left(L\right)
\end{equation}
where $N_{hi}(L)$ is the number at length $L$ in tow $i$ from stratum $h$ and $\widehat \rho_i\left(L\right)$ is the relative efficiency of the chain sweep to rockhopper sweep at length $L$ estimated from the twin trawl observations that may depend on the diel characteristic of tow $i$ if that factor is in the best model fitted to the twin-trawl observations. Note that we have omitted any subscripts denoting the year or season. 

The stratified abundance estimate is then calculated using the design-based estimator, 
\begin{equation}\label{Nal_estimate}
 \widehat N(L) = \sum^H_{h=1} \frac{A_h}{an_h}\sum^{n_h}_{i=1} \widetilde N_{hi}(L)
\end{equation}
where $A_h$ is the area of stratum $h$, $a$ is the average swept area of a survey station tow, and $n_h$ is the number of tows that were made in stratum $h$. The corresponding biomass estimate is then
\begin{equation}\label{biomass_estimate}
 \widehat B = \sum^{n_L}_{l=1} \widehat N(L = l) \widehat W(L=l)
\end{equation}
where $\widehat W(L=l)$ is the predicted weight at length (Eq. \ref{predwal}) from fitting length-weight observations described above. Length is typically measured to the nearest cm so $n_L$ indicates the number of 1 cm length categories observed during the survey. 

We used the same criteria for survey station selection as those currently used to estimate indices of abundance or biomass for management of each stock. For Gulf of Maine winter flounder we also restricted the size classes in each tow to those $\geq$ 30 cm as the biomass of the population over this threshold is currently used for management of this stock. For some stocks there were certain years where some but not all of the set of survey strata used to define indices of abundances were sampled. In those years, the average catch per unit area was expanded to all of the stock strata proportionally to the areas of the sampled and unsampled strata. The fall 2017 survey was extremely restricted because of vessel mechanical failure and indices are not available for summer flounder, SNE-MA windowpane, and SNE-MA yellowtail flounder.


To estimate uncertainty in biomass, we used bootstrap results for the relative catch efficiency and weight at length estimates along with bootstrap samples of the survey data.  Bootstrap data sets for each of the annual surveys respected the stratified random designs by resampling with replacement within each stratum [@smith97]. For each of the 1000 combined bootstraps, survey observations for bootstrap $b$ were scaled with the corresponding bootstrap estimates of relative catch efficiency and predicted weight at length, using Eqs. \ref{Nal_estimate} and \ref{biomass_estimate}.

We also used the bootstraps to summarize other aspects of the biomass estimates. First, we used the bootstraps to calculate the ratio of calibrated and uncalibrated biomass for each spring and fall annual survey which is the implicit relative catch efficiency in terms of biomass. The uncalibrated biomass estimate for bootstrap $b$ uses the resampled survey data as the calibrated biomass estimate except that the bootstrap for the relative catch efficiency is not used (i.e., $\widehat \rho_i\left(L\right) = 1$ in Eq. \ref{nal}). We also used the bootstraps to compare the coefficients of variation (CV) of the calibrated and uncalibrated biomass estimates.  The CV for an annual biomass estimate for year $y$ from either the spring or fall survey was calculated as
\[
\text{CV}\left(\widehat B_y\right) = \frac{\text{SD}\left(\widehat B_y\right)}{\overline{\widehat B}_y}
\]
where
\[
\text{SD}\left(\widehat B_y\right) = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{b=1}^K \left(\widehat B_{y,b} - \overline{\widehat B}_y\right)^2}{K-1}},
\]
\[
\overline{\widehat B}_y = \frac{\sum_{b=1}^K \widehat B_{y,b}}{K},
\]
and $K$ is the number of bootstraps.

For summer flounder it was necessary to omit one of the 1000 bootstraps of relative catch efficiency at length due to an extremely large value to which the standard deviation and mean of the bootstraps were sensitive. Finally, we calculated the correlation of annual biomass estimates for years $y$ and $z$ using the bootstrap estimates of biomass
\[
Cor\left(\widehat B_y, \widehat B_z\right) = \frac{Cov\left(\widehat B_y, \widehat B_z\right)}{\text{SD}\left(\widehat B_y\right)\text{SD}\left(\widehat B_z\right)}
\]
where the covariance is
\[
Cov\left(\widehat B_y, \widehat B_z\right) = \frac{\sum_{b=1}^K \left(\widehat B_{y,b} - \overline{\widehat B}_y\right)\left(\widehat B_{z,b} - \overline{\widehat B}_z\right)}{K-1}.
\]
We summarized the relative precision of the calibrated and uncalibrated biomass estimates as the average of the annual ratios of the CVs for the calibrated and uncalibrated estimates
\[
\frac{1}{n_y} \sum^{n_y}_{y = 1}\frac{CV\left(\widehat B\left(\rho\right)\right)}{CV\left(\widehat B\right)}.
\]
We summarized the correlation of biomass estimates as the mean correlation of all annual calibrated biomass estimates 
\[
\overline {Cor} = \frac{1}{n_y(n_y-1)/2} \sum_{y=2}^{n_y} \sum_{z=1}^{y} Cor\left(\widehat B_y, \widehat B_z\right).
\]

# Results

## Paired-tow observations

In terms of paired tows and total numbers of fish, flatfish were the best sampled species, but goosefish was observed in the most paired-tows and red hake was the most prevalent in terms of total numbers caught (Table \ref{data_table}). Witch flounder was the most prevalent flatfish species caught while yellowtail flounder was the most frequently observed flatfish in terms of paired tows. For all species but summer flounder, and barndoor and thorny skates, only a subsample of all of the fish that were caught were measured for length, but nearly all winter flounder and goosefish were measured.

## Relative catch efficiency

As measured by AIC, the best performing models for all 10 species included size effects on the relative efficiency of the chain and rockhopper sweep gears and between-pair variability in relative catch efficiency (Table \ref{base_model_compare}). Extrabinomial variation (i.e., beta-binomial) in relative catch efficiency at size within pairs was also important for American plaice, yellowtail flounder, witch flounder, red hake, and thorny skate. Model convergence was an issue for all species, particularly for the most complex models with pair-specific smooth functions of length (BI$_4$) and smooth effects of size on the beta-binomial dispersion parameter (BB$_3$,BB$_5$, and BB$_7$).

Including diel effects on relative catch efficiency improved model performance for all species except American plaice (Table \ref{best_model_compare}). For those species with diel effects on relative catch efficiency, the ratio of the efficiencies was generally greater for daytime observations, when fish are typically more closely associate with the sea floor, than those for nighttime tows, with the exception of large winter flounder (Figure \ref{sp_rho_plot}). The largest differences in efficiency was estimated for smaller barndoor skate. For most of the species, the difference in efficiencies between the gears was generally greater for smaller individuals. 

All 1000 bootstrap fits of the paired tow data provided estimates of relative catch efficiency at size for summer, windowpane, and yellowtail flounder, and red hake, goosefish, and thorny skate. All but 2 of the bootstraps for winter flounder and 3 for barndoor skate provided estimates of relative catch efficiency. For witch flounder, 817 bootstraps provided estimates and only 386 provided estimates for American plaice. One bootstrap fit for summer flounder was excluded due to an extremely high relative efficiency of the chain sweep gear which impeded estimation of standard errors from the bootstrap fits.

Generally, where data are prevalent the bootstrap and hessian-based confidence intervals are similar across all species. However, sometimes substantially different perceptions of confidence ranges exist at the extremes of the length range for particular species where there are fewer data and asymptotic properties of estimators can be less applicable.

## Biomass estimation

Total biomass estimates calibrated to the chain sweep gear were variable across years for most stocks and without strong trend (Figure \ref{stock_biomass_plot}). However, declining trends exist for the George Bank and southern New England-Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder stocks and an increasing trend for northern goosefish. Biomass estimates were greatest on average for northern red hake and least for Gulf of Maine winter flounder, although this biomass estimate excludes fish less than 30 cm in length. Fall and spring biomass estimates were similar in scale for most stocks, except that southern New England winter flounder and northern goosefish estimates were typically greater in the fall than the spring. 

The efficiency of the rockhopper sweep in terms of biomass relative to that calibrated to the chain sweep gear varies across survey years and seasons due primarily to differences in size composition, but also variation in estimated length-weight relationship parameters (Figure \ref{stock_biomass_efficiency_plot}). The efficiency of the bottom trawl survey gear was greatest for the winter flounder stocks and American plaice (0.6 to 0.9) and least for red hake, witch flounder, windowpane, and yellowtail flounder stocks (0.2 to 0.4). Precision of the estimated annual biomass efficiencies was lowest for Georges Bank winter flounder and the skate stocks. For Gulf of Maine winter flounder, southern red hake, and barndoor skate, the average fall biomass efficiencies were typically greater than in the spring although the differences were small relative to the confidence intervals.

Comparing the average of estimated coefficients of variation for annual calibrated and uncalibrated biomass estimates showed large increases for summer flounder in the fall ($> 50\%$), southern New England winter flounder in the spring (77%), Georges Bank winter flounder (more than 200\% for spring and fall), northern red hake (95\% for spring and 178\% for fall), northern goosefish in the fall (93\%), and barndoor skate ($>100\%$ for both spring and fall) induced by the variability in the estimation of the relative catch efficiency of the gears using chain and rockhopper sweep gears (Table \ref{stock_cv_ratios}). The effect of calibration on the precision of the biomass estimates was relatively minor for other stocks.

We observed little correlation of annual biomass estimates induced by the relative catch efficiency estimation for most of the stocks (Table \ref{stock_mean_cor}). However, the biomass estimates were highly correlated for George Bank winter flounder in the spring (65\%) and barndoor skate  ($>70\%$ on average). Estimates for Georges Bank winter flounder in the fall, both red hake stocks, northern goosefish, and thorny skate were greater than 20\% on average. 

# Discussion

The data that we used to estimate bottom trawl survey catch efficiency came from an experiment using a twin trawler and many of the standard tow protocols for the NEFSC survey on the *Bigelow*. The experimental net used on one side of the twin trawl was the same as the standard survey trawl used on the *Bigelow* except that it contained roughly half the number of floats and the sweep was modified to optimize flatfish catch by minimizing the ability of flatfish to pass under the net. The other side of the twin trawl was essentially identical to the standard gear used on the *Bigelow.* The towing of the standard survey bottom trawl on the twin trawl experiment differed in a few ways from its deployment on the spring and fall bottom trawl surveys, but we believe that these differences did not have a significant effect on the results. The use of larger doors and the restrictor rope served to fix the net geometries which may be the biggest source of variability in comparative trawl catches. This setup also allowed us to avoid many of the potential problems due to the large differences in size of the *Bigelow* and the *F/V Karen Elizabeth*. We do not suspect that the use of the restrictor rope would influence flatfish behavior in front of the trawl because flatfish have been shown to generally not react to trawling induced stimuli until they are in very close proximity or even contacted by the fishing gear \citep{ryeretal10}. The spread data indicated that the restrictor rope remained taut throughout the towing process (setting, towing, hauling back), so we believe it likely that the restrictor rope was almost always at least 1 m off the bottom. 

Herding is a known phenomenon for flatfish and many other species when certain types of gear are used \citep{rammxiao95,somertonmunro01,somertonetal07,roseetal10}. \citet{somertonmunro01} considered two factors of bridle herding effects on efficiency.  The first factor was the size of the bridle path where the bridle is off the ground ($W_\text{off}$) and the second factor, the herding efficiency ($h$) was the fraction of fish in the bridle contact path moved into the path of the net path. The former is a function of gear design, and controllable, whereas the latter is a function of fish behavior with regard to the bridle when it is in contact with the substrate. The bridle configuration on the bottom trawl survey are designed to minimize contact with the bottom and lack of abrasion of painted bridles used during one of the twin trawler research trips provided evidence of little or no bridle contact during the paired tow experiments used to collect the data used in this study.  Furthermore, studies have consistently found that herding behavior occurred during the daytime \citep{glasswardle89,somertonmunro01,ryerbarnett06,bryanetal14,ryeretal10,deanetal21} with some studies indicating high herding coefficients ($h$) along the sections of the bridles in contact with the bottom. Studies that have evaluated herding at night or in low light conditions did not find evidence for a directional herding response \citep{glasswardle89,ryerbarnett06,ryer08,ryeretal10}. The minimal bridle contact with the substrate and the large fraction of nighttime tows during the bottom trawl survey suggests flatfish herding is unlikely to be an important factor in catch efficiency based on net spread-based swept area.

On the other hand, the biomass estimates assume that the chain sweep gear is fully efficient, but it is likely at least some small fraction of fish, that may depend on size, are not captured by the gear. The biomass estimates also implicitly assume that the entire stock is available to the bottom trawl survey, but many of these stocks extend somewhat outside of the survey strata used to define the indices throughout the year and(or) seasonally due to migration. If either of these assumptions are incorrect this method of biomass estimation would be negatively biased (expected value of biomass estimates would be lower than the true value). However, estimation using the data from these paired-gear studies and these assumptions is less biased than those made without them.

These analyses treat the amount of daylight as binary effect (day/night) on the relative catch efficiency. However, behavior of the fish with respect to the gear is likely to change more gradually with the amount of light. A continuous measure of light that uses the angle of the sun, the depth of the tow and light attenuation with depth, might prove to be a better explanatory variable for changes in relative catch efficiency and perhaps improve estimation of abundance from the bottom trawl survey \citep{jacobsonetal15,kaingeetal17}. 

Aside from the direct impact of estimated catch efficiency of the NEFSC trawl survey gear on biomass estimation, our analyses show more subtle impacts of using independent estimates of efficiency with survey tow data to generate the abundance indices. Without the independent efficiency estimates, the sampling variability  of each of the seasonal and annual relative abundance indices is independent of the others. The bootstrapping methods we employed illustrated that including estimates of catch efficiency affects the variability of the resulting abundance estimates and their independence from each other. For some stocks  there was a substantial effect of the relative catch efficiency estimation on the precision of the biomass indices. Similarly, we found high correlation of annual indices ($> 0.6$) for Georges Bank winter flounder and barndoor skate. In these cases, the decrease in precision and increased correlation may have an impact on bias and precision of important estimates from the assessment model such as stock size and fishing mortality. As such, future work should evaluate the effects of incorporating this information in an assessment model.

The estimates of absolute abundance produced using the sweep comparison experiments have already been informative to assessments and management of many stocks in the Northeast U.S. Chain sweep-based abundance estimates have been used directly in the age-structured assessment model for summer flounder and northern and southern goosefish stocks \citep{nefsc19, nefsc20b}. Abundance estimates for southern New England-Mid-Atlantic winter flounder, both Cape Cod-Gulf of Maine and southern New England- Mid-Atlantic yellowtail flounder stocks, and American plaice were used to validate the abundance estimates produced by the assessment models \citep{nefsc20}. The abundance estimates have also been used directly in assessments for witch flounder, Gulf of Maine winter flounder, Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, northern and southern red hake stocks, which are all assessed using simpler index-based assessment methods \citep{legaultmccurdy17,nefsc20, nefsc20a}. These estimates can be especially valuable for index-based methods where the scale of the stock is assumed known. The abundance estimates have also been used in a supporting fashion for fall-back assessments of both Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank and southern New England-Mid-Atlantic windowpane stocks \citep{nefsc20}. 

Typically, research surveys provide only a relative index of abundance rather than an absolute estimate of abundance. Stock assessment models then integrate these observations with time series of catch and other data sources to determine the scale of the population. However, various factors can make for imprecise and inaccurate scaling of population levels including inaccurate catch data \citep{cadigan16}, time-varying catchability \citep{wilbergetal09}, low fishing mortality rates over the time series \citep{adamsetal14}, and uncertain and time-varying natural mortality \citep{stocketal21}. In these cases, external information such as those produced by studies such as ours, can be particularly useful in estimating the size of of the stock, the status of the stock relative to optimal levels and ultimately making catch advice for commercially important fish stocks.
